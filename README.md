# **MedWaste Guardian: A Multi-Modal AI Agent for Intelligent Biomedical Waste Compliance**  

### **Abstract**  

### **Introduction to the Area**  
Biomedical waste management is a critical aspect of healthcare operations, ensuring environmental safety and regulatory compliance. Improper disposal of medical waste poses severe risks, including the spread of infections, environmental contamination, and legal violations. Traditional waste classification and compliance methods often rely on **manual documentation and outdated regulatory frameworks**, making real-time decision-making inefficient and error-prone. Existing AI-driven solutions focus on **either text-based rule interpretation or image-based classification**, lacking a comprehensive, **multi-modal approach** that integrates **vision, voice, and text for a more interactive and context-aware system**.
